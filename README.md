# Exception Details

Exception Details causes instances of Exception to capture a binding at creation-time.
It provides convenience methods on Exceptions to inspect all the variables and values
from the time of the Exception and adds an informative log string.

Features/benefits:

	* Get detail (variables/values) about your Exception circumstances *without* reproducing the problem.

	* Reduced need for debug/logging code to find out what went wrong.

	* Minimize ambiguous errors (which variable was nil?).

	* A single method for a loggable string (avoid repeating exception log string creation)

	* Get Pry like debug knowledge from cron job errors and running systems from the log, without being there.

	* Pry type information with less overhead/dependencies--binding_of_caller is the only dependency.


## Example Usage

	begin
		greeting = 'hello'
		@name = nil
		puts greeting + @name
	rescue Exception => e
		puts e.details
		puts e.inspect_variables
	end


	e.details ->

		Exception:
			TypeError: can't convert nil into String
		Variables:
			<String> greeting                   = "hello"
			<NilClass> @name                    = nil

		Backtrace:
			/Users/someguy/apps/exception_details/spec/exception_details_spec.rb:20:in `+'
		/Users/someguy/apps/exception_details/spec/exception_details_spec.rb:20:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'
		/Users/someguy/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p374/gems/rspec-core-2.14.3/lib/rspec/core/example.rb:114:in `instance_eval'
		and so forth ...


	e.inspect_variables ->

		<String> greeting = "hello"
		<TypeError> e = #<TypeError: can't convert nil into String>
		<NilClass> @name = nil

Or access the variables in the binding yourself...

	e.binding_during_exception.eval("puts #{greeting}")

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

    gem 'exception_details'

Execute:

    $ bundle

Require it:

	require 'exception_details'

## Limitations
- This gem requires [binding\_of\_caller](https://github.com/banister/binding_of_caller), so it should only work with MRI 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0
and RBX (Rubinius). Does not work in 1.8.7, but there is a well known (continuation-based)
hack to get a Binding#of_caller there. There is some mention about binding of caller supporting
jruby, so feel free to try it out.

- Getting a binding from a NameError seems to be problematic.

- This gem is still new...

- binding_of_caller is experiencing some segfault issues on some rubies, so this is not
  ideal for a production stack...  Shame, as how awesome would using this in production be?
